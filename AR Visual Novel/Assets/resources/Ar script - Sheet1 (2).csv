p1,"my cubemate next to me, we became pretty good friends. He was maybe 45, 46, long gray hair, well put together, shirt tucked in, prim and proper, and I kind of looked up to him a little bit, and we were cubemates so we became good friends.",none,10,a10

p1,"Which to me? I thought that was crazy, you got two kids you just custody and you're going to go on a week-long trip to Russia, it just seemed strange.

p1,"Immediately, I noticed something was different. he was speaking in Russian. And this guy wasn't russian, He'd never spoken Russian before. Even when he's speaking in English, He's speaking in a Russian accent.",none,23,a23
p1,"at first everybody's laughing about it, sometimes you go to England or something, you'll come back with a little English twang or something, but now he was even speaking to customers on the phone in Russian in a Russian accent. Throughout the day we thought okay, that's funny, but it's time to give it a rest, but now it just gets thicker and thicker.",none,24,a24
p1,"So that was the day, but it wasn't till that evening till things started to get creepy",none,25,a25
p1,I'm sitting at home. It's dark. It's pretty late in the evening. I just remember all the lights were out and I'm sitting on my couch watching television and I get a ring.,none,26,a26
p1,"It's the oldest son, I said hey buddy, how's it going? And he was whispering, and I'll never forget what he said.",none,27,a27
p1,He said help this isn't our dad.,none,28,a28
p1,"I wanted to drop the phone. I wanted to hang up and I didn't want any part of it. I mean I still get chills right now because I can hear that voice, he was desperate.",none,29,a29
p1,"It was like something out of a movie, he gets his kids, he leaves for Russia, He comes back a totally different guy. New look, a new speech. So I try to get more information like hey, what do you mean? What do you mean he's not your dad?",none,30,a30
p1,He said can you come over here? We're scared. We don't know what to do.,none,31,a31
p1,So I go.,none,32,a32
p1,It's about 30 minute ride over to the house and in my head is racing and I didn't know what I was going to be walking into.,none,33,a33
p1,It was pretty tense. My mind was fried a little bit. I was definitely wondering what am I getting myself into here? What am I going to walk into?,none,34,a34
p1,"So I go to the apartment and knocked on the door. He opens the door arms out big hug, you know, he's got that Russian accent again, and he goes ""come in, I'm making dinner"", some russian dish.",none,35,a35
p1,"The guys in there making a Russian dish. He's Russian, and that accent is even thicker. The boys are kind of peering around the corner from the living room, scared to go into the kitchen.",none,36,a36
p1,"at this point I'm really investigating, really trying to figure out what's going on with Don.",none,37,a37
p1,"His eyes are different, chest hair hanging out, big gold chain, he's a full-fledged Russian mobster now.",none,38,a38
p1,"I was in my head thinking okay, it's not him.  The boys  have been living with him, he's been back for 24 hours, and they're telling me this is not my dad.",none,39,a39
p1,"He speaking like a mobster, He's carrying himself like a Russian mobster, I don't know what's going on with him or if it even is him.",none,40,a40
p1,"I go talk to the boys, they're scared, they feel trapped.",none,41,a41
p1,"And I said, you know, we got to get a hold of your mom. Have you called your mom after the custody battle? I found out this that night the mom had moved to Israel. Now, this is early 2000s, Google search wasn't as good, and not everybody had cell phone so they had a hard time getting a hold of their mom.",none,42,a42
p1,"there was nothing I could do, so I had to tell them to hold tight, and went home. It was crazy, I didn't want to deal with this, it was like something out of a movie!",none,43,a43
p1,"I thought, maybe  was he was Russian all along. A Russian spy or a Manchurian Candidate or something like that, and his mission was over and when he comes back to the States, now he can just be full-fledged Russian and he didn't care anymore.",none,44,a44
p1,"There was a creepyness about his eyes, kind of a blank stare, and he never broke character once.",none,45,a45
p1,I go to work the next morning and he's still in the same get up carrying himself like a Russian mobster. He's just not himself.,none,46,a46
p1,And of course everybody work is coming up to me saying hey and what's what's up with Don? Why is he acting like that? it's so weird. and I don't have any answers for them,none,47,a47
p1,"We do decide to go do a little happy hour, some of the guys and gals at work. We're at a little happy hour spot, and everybody's got an opinion on what happened to Don.",none,48,a48
p1,"I'm talking to, it gets quiet and I could tell, he's behind me.",none,49,a49
p1,"And he's just standing there with this stare, with these eyes, dark black hair from the dyr, his Russian mobster getup. He's just standing there looking at us, our table.",none,50,a50
p1,"I remember that night it turned from it was funny, to little bit annoying, and now I'm just angry. I'm like, come on man, what's wrong with you?",none,51,a51
p1,"The next morning I go to work, but he doesn't show up. I called the boys and they're still a little frightened and they say he didn't come home last night.",none,52,a52
p1,"I feared the worst, hey said can you come get us we just want out of here.",none,53,a53
p1,"So I got them, and left a note for Don saying ""hey man, you need to get things straight. the boys are gonna stay with me until you start acting right.",none,54,a54
p1,"Once I had the boys at my house, but that was probably when things came to a head.",none,55,a55
p1,"Later that night, there was a loud knocking on the door, an angry booming knock.",none,56,a56
p1,"Don was banging on the door, an angry russian mobster screaming about how I had kidnapped his kids, and how I couldn't do this, and he wanted them back.",none,57,a57
p1,"I told him through the door that his kids were scared, and that I was scared, and that if he didnt leave I would call the cops",none,58,a58
p1,"he he slows down and he said okay, I'll be better tomorrow. I'll be better tomorrow.",none,59,a59
p1,"I felt crazy. Is this real? Is this really going on? It was like his Russian brother or something, It was it was a totally different guy.",none,60,a60
p1,"""What did this guy do with Don?"" the boys were probably thinking, ""what do he do with our real dad""",none,61,a61
p1,"At this point, I mean, he knows where I live, and I am really scared, and I'm debating. I think I need to call the cops. I think I need to get them involved on this.",none,62,a62
p1,"The next morning he comes to work. he's at it again, and he's out of control, the boss comes over to try to talk to him and Don starts cussing him out infront of everyone",none,63,a63
p1,"He gets fired and then he doesn't take it very well. He takes one of those tin cans, you know the holiday tin cans with popcorn in it. He takes one of those and throws it at the boss, popcorn goes everywhere. They call the cops.",none,64,a64
p1,"The police common and put him in a straight jacket, and that was the last time I saw Don.",none,65,a65
p1,"of course after this the entire office is a buzz about what happened, and everyone's got their own theories about Don. All i know is what I saw was a normal guy, and within a week he comes back as someone else.",off,66,a66
p1,"The boys ended up getting a flight out to the ex-wife, she sent some tickets. We got them on a plane and got them back to their mom, and she filled me in on Don's life.",none,67,a67
p1,"For years he was just this great, well respected guy, but he just wanted to take care of his kids, so much that he felt he needed to give them a mother.",none,68,a68
p1,"So he went to Russia to get a mail order bride. While he was there, he forgot his medication from the states. I didn't really know about mental illness at that time, but once he got to Russia he didn't have his medication.",none,69,a69
p1,"When his mind flipped he was Russian. That was his new normal. That was his new life. He was a Russian. To see a person that you respected who was living a normal life, to see how that can just change in an instant, It really opened my eyes to just have tragic mental illness is",none,70,a70
p1,"yea so I guess that's my story for ya man, at first it was funny, then annoying, then scary, and then tragic.",none,71,a71
